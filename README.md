# weather-app
a weather app

A responsive weather application that shows the current weather and 2 day forcast of any given city inputed by the user using HTML, SCSS and Javascript.

This project is setup on Visual Studio Code and hosted on firebase. The aim of the project is to demonstrate my ability to fetch a third party api and display its content.

Vanilla javascript is used for the majority of the application to fetch the api and also display the relevant weather forcast information depending on the city the 
user adds to the input. Custom Html and Css is used to showcase my knowledge of the technologies without requiring any library. Sass is used for features such as mixin's
and nesting to allow for a smoother workflow and helps to keep things organized while also allowing me to create stylesheets faster. Media queries are used to ensure the 
websites responsiveness.
